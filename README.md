This project is a simple neural network maden in javascript as known as MLP(Multilayer Perceptron) also.

The matrix library was maden by myself for the neural net too, and it can be used for any project.

# How it works?
Long story short, a neural network is a universal function aproximator.
If you want understand better, I really recommend you some articles:

[Wikipedia - MLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)
